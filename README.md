# Data Analysis on The Stroop Effect
Data Analysis on The Stroop Effect by Favour Eze. (Psy Course Project 200 Level)

## ABSTRACT

An experiment was conducted to see if stimuli conflicted with response time. This experiment was modeled after Stroop’s experiment in 1935. Participants consisted of 24 students at Covenant University. Students were of various ethnicities and were of ages 18 and above. 
<br>

Participants were shown 2 lists of the same eighteen words, spelling out colours. The participants were asked to read the colour of the ink and not the word. The first list showed words written in colours congruent to each word. The second showed words written in colours incongruent to each word. The independent variable was the ink colour used. The dependent variable was the time taken for the student to say the colour ink. Post-test only with control group design was used. Scores were analysed to find the range, mean, median, mode and standard deviation for each list. It was found that participants had trouble reading the list of incongruent coloured ink due to a conflict in stimuli. 
<br>

The Stroop task teaches us that when reading becomes an automatic process, simple tasks such as identifying the font color of a word that spells a color can be very difficult.

## OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS

The terminologies and variables used in Stroop Effect Experiment:

* __Congruent__: the term means to be exactly equal in shape and size. In this case it means to agree or to be in harmony.
* __Incongruent__: to be in disharmony or disagreement with an affecting component
* __Stimuli__: a thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in something or someone
* __Independent variable (IV)__:  Nature of stimuli, i.e.  congruent and incongruent
* __Dependent variable (DV)__:  reaction time taken and score based on errors committed.

## RESEARCH QUESTION AND HYPOTHESIS STATEMENTS

How does the Stroop effect impact the time it takes to name the color of a word? This research question aims to investigate the cognitive processes involved in the Stroop effect and their impact on perception and behavior. In this research paper, we will be using a null hypothesis, H0 because it can be used to determine whether a link exists between two measurable variables. It can tell us if the findings were acquired by chance or by influencing phenomena. 

* __Research question__:  Is there any significant difference in reaction time and score between congruent and incongruent conditions?

* __Null Hypothesis, H0__: there is no significant difference in the reaction time and score between congruent and incongruent condition i.e mean of control group (M1) = mean of experimental group (M2). 

* __Alternative Hypothesis, H1__: there is significant difference in the reaction time and score between congruent and incongruent condition i.e mean of control group (M1) ≠ mean of experimental group (M2).

## POPULATION

In this research our population was based on covenant university students.
There were 24 participants from Covenant University. Participants were between the ages of 18 and above. No one reported a color deficiency.

## SAMPLE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUE

* Sample size: The sample size used were 100 level international relation students and sociology students, 200 level students from the college of engineering, college of computer science and technology, 300 level students from the college of leadership and development studies.

* Sampling techniques: convenience sampling and simple random sampling.
  
  - Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling method where units are selected for inclusion in the sample because they are the easiest for the researcher to access. This can be due to geographical proximity, availability at a given time, or willingness to participate in the research. 
  - Simple random sampling is a sampling technique in which each member of a population has an equal chance of being chosen through the use of an unbiased selection method. Each subject in the sample is given a number, and then the sample is chosen by a random method.
<br>

She used these sampling techniques due to geographical disadvantages, willingness, and limited time in gathering participants, and to assign her participants to groups, She used a ballot picking method. After they had gotten their numbers, she assigned the even numbers to the control group and the odd numbers to the experimental group.

## DATA ANALYSIS

For the data analysis, the descriptive information of the observed data was computed using google sheets and the independent samples t-Test was also used for the statistical data analysis method in SPSS too.

<br>

__Scoring system__
* 1 (very fast) – 10-5 seconds and above
* 2 (fast) – 10 -15 seconds  
* 3 (medium) – 15-20 seconds 
* 4 (slow) – 20-25 seconds
* 5 (very slow) – 25- 30 seconds and above

<br>

For the analysis of the data, the scores were analysed to get the descriptive summary such as  the range, mean, median, mode and standard deviation for each list. The descriptive statistics for the groups (control and experimental) as well as other statistical analysis methods were carried out for the reaction times where the independent variable was the ink colour used and the dependent variable was the time taken for the student to say the colour ink. 
<br>

The variables used in Stroop Effect Experiment:

* Independent variable (IV) – Nature of stimuli, i.e.  congruent and incongruent
* Dependent variable (DV) – reaction time taken and score based on errors calculated via the scoring system.

```
The difference between the mean reaction times of the incongruent stimuli and congruent stimuli based on participants' response on the color of the color-words is given by:

> Stroop Effect Values = Mean Reaction for Incongruent –   Mean Reaction for Congruent 
> Stroop Effect values (Reaction Time) = MRTI –   MRTC
> Stroop Effect values (Reaction Time)  = 23.76 – 13.16 = 10.60 ≠ 0

Where: 
* MRTI represents the mean reaction time for the incongruent observations of the control group.
* MRTC represents the mean reaction time for the congruent observations of the experimental group.
* The stroop effect value for the mean reaction represents the difference between the mean reaction time for the control group and the mean reaction time for the experimental group.
```

```
The difference between the mean reaction times of the incongruent stimuli and congruent stimuli based on participants' response on the color of the color-words is given by:

> Stroop Effect Values = Mean Scores for Incongruent –  Mean Scores for Congruent 
> Stroop Effect values (Scores) = MSI –   MSC
> Stroop Effect values (Scores)   = 4.08 – 2.00 = 2.08 ≠ 0

Where: 
* MSI represents the mean score for the incongruent observations of the control group.
* MSC represents the mean score for the congruent observations of the experimental group.
* The stroop effect value for the mean score represents the difference between the mean score for the control group and the mean score for the experimental group.

## Conclusion

From the tables; t = -4.795, p = .000
<br>

The Decision rule states that;
* If p < 0.05, then reject the null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis.
* If p > 0.05, then accept the null hypothesis and reject alternative hypothesis.

<br>
From the results above, the significant value “p”, is .000. Therefore, from the decision rule stated above the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted. Therefore, there is significant difference in the reaction time and score between congruent and incongruent condition.
